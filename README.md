# CypherRogDemo-2

**This Repository is created for demo in Git and GitHub.**

Things to be ~~NOT~~ done for making an Repository
+ *Created an empty Repository named:* `CypherRogDemo-2` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied contents from the page titled `create new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# CypherRogDemo-2" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Harsha-2324/CypherRogDemo-2.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I've created an empty folder in file explorer and open the file in CMD.
+ Just copy paste and execute each lines.
	+ This first line `echo "# CypherRogDemo-2" >> README.md` created a README.md with a content `# CypherRogDemo-2`
